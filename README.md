This is an basic carousel created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) based on the following model where each image in the carousel is a randomly selected image within each block.

```
[
  {
    title:  "First Block",
    images:  [
      "img-url",
      "img-url",
      ...
    ],
  }
  ...
],
```
